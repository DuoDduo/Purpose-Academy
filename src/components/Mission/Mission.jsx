        <p>
          The discovery and fulfilment of God's divine purpose is achieved through 
          the undiluted teachings of God's Word, Holy Spirit impartations, mentorship 
          classes, and other means revealed by God to bring about the fulfilment of 
          the divine mandate.

              The subject of purpose is all-encompassing, necessitating the need for 
              instruction, stability, direction, and empowerment in every area of life, 
              which in turn affects purpose fulfilment. Hence, School of Purpose focuses 
              on teachings, impartations, and mentorship in every aspect of life that 
              affects the fulfilment of Purpose. God's desire is for our lives to be 
              filled with His glory, reflecting heaven on earth, and securing our 
              eternal place with Him after our sojourn. <strong>This is the core 
              focus of the School of Purpose.</strong>
