                <p>
                    <p>The discovery and fulfilment of God's divine purpose, is achieved through the undiluted teachings of God's Word, HolySpirit Impartations, mentorship classes, and other means revealed by God to bring about the fulfilment of the divine mandate.</p>
                   <p> The subject of purpose is all-encompassing, necessitating the need for instruction, stability, direction and empowerment in every area of life, which in turn affects purpose fulfilment. Hence, School of Purpose focuses on teachings, impartations and mentorship in every aspect of life that affects the fulfilment of Purpose. </p>
                    God's desire is for our lives to be filled with His glory hereby reflecting heaven on earth, and for us to have an eternal place with Him after our sojourn. This is the core focus of the School of Purpose.
